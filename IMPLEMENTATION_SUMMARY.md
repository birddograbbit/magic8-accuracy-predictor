# Implementation Summary - Magic8 Accuracy Predictor

This file provides a concise recap of Phase 1 implementation steps and key
results. It is referenced by other documentation such as `CLEANUP_PLAN.md`.

## Phase 1 Highlights
- Processed 1.5M trades with an optimized pipeline
- Engineered 74 features including temporal, price based and strategy flags
- Trained an XGBoost classifier (GPU accelerated)
- Achieved **88.21%** test accuracy with an AUC of **0.95**
- Saved the model to `models/phase1/` for real-time use

## Pipeline Steps
1. Run `process_magic8_data_optimized_v2.py` to normalize raw trade data.
2. Execute `src/phase1_data_preparation.py` to build the feature matrices.
3. Train the model via `src/models/xgboost_baseline.py`.
4. Results are stored under `models/phase1/results.json` and a pickled
   wrapper is saved for inference.

These steps complete the minimal MVP required for accurate prediction of
Magic8 trade outcomes and serve as the foundation for later phases.
