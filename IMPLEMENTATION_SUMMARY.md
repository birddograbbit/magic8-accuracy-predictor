# Magic8 Accuracy Predictor - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive implementation plan and initial codebase for predicting the accuracy of Magic8's trading predictions using a Transformer-based ensemble approach.

## What's Been Created

### 1. Implementation Plan (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)
- Detailed architecture design
- Three-phase implementation approach
- Technology stack and frameworks
- Success criteria and timeline

### 2. Data Preparation Pipeline (`src/data_preparation.py`)
- Loads your normalized trading data
- Fetches VIX data from Yahoo Finance
- Adds temporal features (cyclical encoding)
- Calculates technical indicators
- Creates train/validation/test splits
- Handles class imbalance

### 3. Configuration System (`configs/model_config.yaml`)
- Transformer architecture settings
- XGBoost parameters
- Decision Tree for market regime
- Ensemble configuration
- Production deployment settings

### 4. Quick Start Script (`quick_start.py`)
- Tests data loading
- Installs dependencies
- Runs data preparation pipeline
- Provides next steps guidance

### 5. Data Exploration Notebook (`notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`)
- Visualizes target distribution
- Analyzes feature correlations
- Shows time-based patterns
- Creates sequences for model training

## Architecture Summary

### Data Pipeline
```
Normalized Data → Feature Engineering → Sequences → Models → Ensemble → Prediction
                         ↓
                    VIX Data
                    Technical Indicators
                    Time Features
```

### Model Ensemble
1. **Transformer**: For sequential pattern recognition
2. **XGBoost**: For feature interactions
3. **Decision Tree**: For market regime classification
4. **Ensemble**: Weighted voting mechanism

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Framework Choice
- Using **QuantStock** (https://github.com/MXGao-A/QuantStock) as base
- Production-ready with comprehensive features
- Easy to adapt for binary classification

### 2. Feature Engineering
- VIX as primary market indicator
- Cyclical encoding for time features
- Technical indicators using `ta` library
- Market regime classification (Low/Medium/High volatility)

### 3. Handling Class Imbalance
- Balanced class weights in loss function
- Option for SMOTE oversampling
- Stratified splits for validation

## Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Install Dependencies and Test Data
```bash
cd /Users/jt/magic8/magic8-accuracy-predictor
python quick_start.py
```

### 2. Clone and Adapt QuantStock
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MXGao-A/QuantStock.git
# Copy and modify for binary classification
```

### 3. Implement Binary Classification Models
Key modifications needed:
- Change output layer to sigmoid activation
- Use BCEWithLogitsLoss
- Add class weighting
- Modify metrics for classification

### 4. Train Individual Models
Start with single models before ensemble:
- Train Transformer first
- Then XGBoost
- Finally ensemble

### 5. Production Deployment
- FastAPI service
- Docker container
- Real-time predictions

## Key Features Added

### 1. VIX Integration
- Automatic fetching from Yahoo Finance
- Market regime classification
- VIX-based features (MA, change rate)

### 2. Temporal Features
- Cyclical encoding (sin/cos)
- Market hours indicator
- Day of week/month patterns

### 3. Technical Indicators
- RSI (14-period)
- Moving averages (5, 20)
- Price momentum
- Volatility measures

## Performance Targets
- Model accuracy > 65%
- Consistent performance across market regimes
- Real-time prediction < 100ms
- System uptime > 99.9%

## Risk Management
- Confidence thresholds
- Ensemble fallback
- Performance monitoring
- A/B testing framework

## Timeline
- Week 1: Complete data preparation ✅
- Week 2: Model implementation
- Week 3: Production deployment
- Week 4: Optimization and monitoring

## Support
The implementation follows the "ship fast, enhance later" principle. Start with the basic models and iterate based on performance.

All code is modular and well-documented for easy enhancement.
