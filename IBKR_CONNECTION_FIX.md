# IBKR Connection Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Model File Path Issue
**Problem**: The prediction API was looking for `models/xgboost_phase1.pkl` but the actual file is `models/xgboost_phase1_model.pkl`

**Fix**: Updated `src/prediction_api.py` line 69 to use the correct filename with `_model` suffix.

### 2. IBKR Contract Subscription Errors
**Problem**: When disconnecting, the system was trying to cancel market data for contracts that were never successfully subscribed, causing "No reqId found" errors.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `disconnect()` method in `standalone_provider.py` to handle missing tickers gracefully
- Fixed `cancelMktData()` calls to use ticker objects instead of contracts
- Added proper error handling to ignore cancel errors during disconnect

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Model Files
```bash
cd /Users/jt/magic8/magic8-accuracy-predictor
python test_model_files.py
```

### 2. Test IBKR Connection
```bash
cd /Users/jt/magic8/magic8-accuracy-predictor
python test_ibkr_connection.py
```

### 3. Run the Prediction API
```bash
cd /Users/jt/magic8/magic8-accuracy-predictor
python src/prediction_api.py
```

## Expected Behavior

1. The model should load successfully from `models/xgboost_phase1_model.pkl`
2. IBKR connection should establish without errors
3. Symbols with subscription issues (like NDX) should:
   - Log a warning: "Market data subscription missing for NDX"
   - Fall back to mock data
   - Not cause the entire connection to fail
4. Disconnect should complete without "No reqId found" errors

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages:
- `INFO: Loaded model from models/xgboost_phase1_model.pkl` ✓
- `INFO: Connected to IBKR on client_id=99` ✓
- `WARNING: Market data subscription missing for NDX` (expected for unsubscribed symbols)
- `INFO: Using mock data for symbols without subscriptions: ['NDX']` ✓

## Next Steps

If you still see issues:
1. Ensure IBKR Gateway/TWS is running on port 7497
2. Check that you have market data subscriptions for the symbols you need
3. Consider adding NDX to your IBKR market data subscriptions if needed
