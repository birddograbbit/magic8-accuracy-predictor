# Files to Remove After Merge

The following empty files should be removed after merging:
- IB_CONNECTION_FIX_SUMMARY.md (empty)
- connection_comparison.py (empty)  
- start_simple_api.py (duplicate of start_api_simple.py)
- test_simple_connection.py (empty)
- src/simple_ib/ (entire empty directory)

These were created during development but are not needed in the final solution.

The essential files are:
- src/prediction_api_simple.py
- test_direct_ib.py
- start_api_simple.py
- run_simple_api.sh
- README_IB_FIX.md
