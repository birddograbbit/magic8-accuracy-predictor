# Magic8 Accuracy Predictor - Implementation Plan (Updated)

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the implementation plan for building a Transformer-based system to predict the accuracy (win/loss) of Magic8's 0DTE options trading predictions. The system trades SPX, SPY, RUT, QQQ, XSP, NDX, AAPL, and TSLA using three strategies: Butterfly (debit), Iron Condor (credit), and Vertical Spreads (credit).

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Data Pipeline
- **Input Features**: 
  - Temporal: Time features with 0DTE-specific indicators (time to expiry, theta decay)
  - Market Structure: VIX, VVIX, Put-Call ratio, GEX, term structure
  - Technical: Price data, RSI, MA, ATR, Bollinger Bands, momentum
  - Microstructure: Bid-ask spreads, volume profile, order flow
  - Cross-asset: DXY, Treasury yields, sector ETFs, futures spreads
  - Option-specific: Moneyness, delta, premium ratios, strategy encoding
  - Price Action: Pivot points, acceleration, distance from key levels
- **Output**: Binary classification (1=profit, 0=loss)
- **Data Source**: 3 years of normalized trading data (2022-2025)

### 2. Model Architecture
We will adapt the **QuantStock** framework (https://github.com/MXGao-A/QuantStock) which provides:
- Production-ready implementation
- Multiple model architectures (Transformer, LSTM, XGBoost)
- Comprehensive backtesting framework
- Modular design for easy customization

### 3. Ensemble Approach
- **Strategy-Specific Models**: Separate models for Butterfly, Iron Condor, and Vertical Spreads
- **Transformer**: Sequential pattern recognition with attention mechanism
- **XGBoost**: Feature importance and non-linear relationships
- **Market Regime Classifier**: Adapt predictions based on volatility regime
- **Meta-Learner**: Weighted ensemble based on recent performance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Enhancement (COMPLETED ✓)

#### 1.1 Feature Engineering
```python
# Implemented features:
- Market Data:
  - VIX and VVIX (volatility of volatility)
  - Cross-asset correlations (DXY, Treasuries, Sector ETFs)
  - Futures vs cash spreads
  
- Temporal Features (0DTE specific):
  - Minutes to expiry with exponential decay
  - Intraday seasonality (power hour, lunch lull)
  - Options expiration effects
  - Economic event indicators
  
- Technical Indicators (All symbols including AAPL, TSLA):
  - RSI, Multiple MAs (5, 10, 20, 50)
  - ATR, Bollinger Bands
  - Price acceleration (2nd derivative)
  - Pivot points and distances
  
- Option-Specific:
  - Strategy encoding (one-hot)
  - Moneyness and log-moneyness
  - Premium normalized by price
  - Risk-reward ratios
  - Delta features (gamma proxy)
  
- Market Regimes:
  - 5-level VIX classification
  - IV rank and percentile
  - Term structure indicators
```

#### 1.2 Data Preparation Script (ENHANCED ✓)
Created enhanced `src/data_preparation.py`:
- Loads normalized_aggregated.csv
- Fetches VIX, VVIX, and cross-asset data
- Calculates 100+ features across categories
- Handles all 8 symbols and 3 strategies
- Creates sequences optimized for 0DTE
- Temporal train/val/test split

### Phase 2: Model Development (Next Phase)

#### 2.1 Fork and Adapt QuantStock
1. Fork repository to `magic8-accuracy-predictor`
2. Create custom modules:
   - `src/models/BinaryTransformer.py`
   - `src/models/StrategySpecificModels.py`
   - `src/data/Magic8DataLoader.py`
   - `src/ensemble/AdaptiveEnsemble.py`

#### 2.2 Model Modifications for 0DTE
```python
# Key enhancements for 0DTE options:
1. Time-aware attention mechanism
2. Strategy-specific embeddings
3. Volatility regime conditioning
4. Multi-task learning (win/loss + profit magnitude)
5. Asymmetric loss function (penalize false positives more)
```

#### 2.3 Training Pipeline
- Strategy-stratified k-fold cross-validation
- Time-decay weighted loss function
- Adaptive learning rate based on market regime
- Feature importance analysis per strategy
- Walk-forward optimization

### Phase 3: Production Deployment

#### 3.1 Real-time API Service
```python
# FastAPI endpoints:
/predict - Real-time prediction with <50ms latency
/predict/strategy/{strategy_type} - Strategy-specific predictions
/market/regime - Current market regime classification
/features/importance - Real-time feature importance
/backtest - Historical performance analysis
```

#### 3.2 Production Features
- Sub-second data ingestion pipeline
- Real-time feature calculation
- Model versioning with A/B testing
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Risk limits and circuit breakers

## Key Metrics to Track

### 1. Strategy-Specific Metrics
- Win rate by strategy (Butterfly, Iron Condor, Vertical)
- Average profit/loss by time of day
- Performance by market regime
- Slippage and transaction costs

### 2. Model Performance
- Feature importance rankings
- Prediction confidence vs actual accuracy
- False positive/negative analysis
- Regime transition handling

### 3. Risk Metrics
- Maximum consecutive losses
- Tail risk (95th percentile losses)
- Correlation with market moves
- Strategy concentration risk

## 0DTE-Specific Considerations

### 1. Time Decay Management
- Exponential weighting of features as expiry approaches
- Separate models for different time buckets
- Dynamic confidence thresholds

### 2. Volatility Smile Modeling
- Strike-specific adjustments
- Skew indicators
- Wing risk management

### 3. Execution Challenges
- Wider bid-ask spreads near expiry
- Rapid delta changes
- Pin risk near strikes
