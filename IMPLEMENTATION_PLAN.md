# Magic8 Accuracy Predictor - Implementation Plan

## üìä Current Status (June 30, 2025)

### Phase 1 MVP Progress
- ‚úÖ **Data Processing**: Complete - 1.5M trades processed in 0.6 minutes
- ‚úÖ **All Strategies Found**: Butterfly, Iron Condor, Vertical, Sonar
- ‚úÖ **Column Mapping Fixed**: phase1_data_preparation_fixed.py ready
- ‚è≥ **ML Pipeline**: Ready to execute
- ‚è≥ **IBKR Data**: 2/9 symbols downloaded (SPX, VIX)

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Run `python src/phase1_data_preparation.py` (use fixed version)
2. Train XGBoost with `python src/models/xgboost_baseline.py`
3. Download remaining IBKR symbols

Source CSVs                     IBKR Market Data
```

### Current Tools & Frameworks
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **ML Framework**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Market Data**: IBKR API
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn

### Future Considerations
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch (if needed)
- **Production**: FastAPI, Docker
- **Monitoring**: MLflow, Weights & Biases

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets
- Accuracy: >60% (vs 50% random)
- Consistent performance across strategies
- Feature importance insights
- Clear improvement path

### Long-term Goals
- Accuracy: >70%
- Real-time predictions
- Strategy-specific optimization
- Risk-adjusted returns improvement

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Overfitting**: Use proper validation, simple models first
- **Data Quality**: Extensive validation, outlier detection
- **Performance**: Start simple, optimize later

### Business Risks
- **Market Changes**: Regular model retraining
- **Strategy Evolution**: Modular architecture
- **Regulatory**: Compliance-ready documentation

## Timeline

### Phase 1 (2 weeks) - IN PROGRESS
- Week 1: ‚úÖ Data pipeline, feature engineering
- Week 2: ‚è≥ Model training, evaluation

### Phase 2 (4 weeks)
- Weeks 3-4: Enhanced features
- Weeks 5-6: Advanced models

### Phase 3 (4 weeks)
- Weeks 7-8: Production infrastructure
- Weeks 9-10: Testing and deployment

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why Start Simple?
1. **Faster Time to Value**: 2 weeks to working system
2. **Baseline Performance**: Know what to beat
3. **Feature Insights**: Learn what matters
4. **Lower Risk**: Proven methods first

### Why XGBoost First?
1. **Interpretability**: Feature importance
2. **Performance**: Often beats complex models
3. **Speed**: Fast training and inference
4. **Robustness**: Handles mixed data types

### Why Phased Approach?
1. **Risk Management**: Fail fast, learn quickly
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Don't over-engineer
3. **Stakeholder Confidence**: Show progress
4. **Technical Debt**: Keep it manageable
