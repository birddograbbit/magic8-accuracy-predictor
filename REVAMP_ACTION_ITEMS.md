- [x] Add symbol-aware feature generation
- [x] Configure model routing in config.yaml
- [x] Fix VIX change calculations in data provider
- [x] Add risk/reward calculator endpoint and parser (Phase 7)

### Documentation
- [x] Update multi-model overview
- [x] Document configuration structure
- [x] Create threshold optimization guide
- [x] Update API documentation

## ‚è≥ Remaining Actions

### Deployment (1-2 days)
- [ ] Deploy API to production environment
- [ ] Configure production data sources
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Enable production logging

### Validation (3-5 days)
- [ ] Run paper trading for 48 hours
- [ ] Compare profit vs baseline
- [ ] Validate threshold effectiveness
- [ ] Monitor model latency

### Integration (2-3 days)
- [ ] Complete DiscordTrading connection
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow
- [ ] Set up error handling
- [ ] Configure retry logic

### Monitoring (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerting rules
- [ ] Implement model drift detection
- [ ] Configure backup procedures

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] All models trained and validated
- [x] Thresholds optimized and saved
- [x] API tested locally
- [x] Configuration complete
- [ ] Production environment ready
- [ ] Backup procedures documented

### Deployment Day
- [ ] Stop paper trading
- [ ] Deploy API service
- [ ] Verify model loading
- [ ] Test all endpoints
- [ ] Enable monitoring
- [ ] Start with limited symbols

### Post-Deployment  
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Check profit metrics
- [ ] Review trade logs
- [ ] Adjust thresholds if needed
- [ ] Full rollout decision

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Technical
- [x] 90%+ model accuracy achieved
- [x] <200ms prediction latency
- [x] All features implemented
- [ ] 99.9% uptime in production

### Business
- [ ] 50%+ profit improvement over baseline
- [ ] 70%+ trade selectivity
- [ ] Reduced drawdowns
- [ ] Consistent daily profits

## üìä Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Model Overfitting**: Mitigated with grouped models
2. **Threshold Drift**: Monitor and adjust weekly
3. **Data Quality**: Validate inputs in real-time
4. **Latency Issues**: Cache frequently used data

### Contingency Plans
- Fallback to default model if issues
- Paper trading toggle for testing
- Threshold override capability
- Manual trade approval option

---

**Next Immediate Action**: Deploy to production environment and begin validation phase.
