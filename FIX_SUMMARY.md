# Fix Summary: Magic8 Accuracy Predictor Issues

## Issues Encountered and Fixed

### 1. **Categorical Column Issues**
- **Problem**: The original `vix_regime` and `strategy_type` columns (containing string values like 'elevated', 'Butterfly') were not dropped after one-hot encoding
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `phase1_data_preparation.py` to drop original categorical columns after one-hot encoding
  - Updated `xgboost_baseline.py` to automatically detect and exclude any object/string columns as a safety net

### 2. **JSON Serialization Error**
- **Problem**: NumPy int64 types couldn't be serialized to JSON when saving results
- **Solution**: Added a converter function to convert all NumPy types to native Python types before JSON serialization

### 3. **Class Imbalance in Validation/Test Sets**
- **Problem**: The validation and test sets have almost no positive samples (winning trades)
- **Likely Cause**: Temporal distribution shift - the trading strategy's performance may have changed over time
- **Impact**: The model shows 99.9% accuracy but 0% recall on validation/test sets

## Scripts Created

1. **`rebuild_data.py`** - Comprehensive script to rebuild all data from scratch with validation
2. **`diagnose_features.py`** - Shows which features are being used vs excluded
3. **`diagnose_class_imbalance.py`** - Analyzes target distribution over time and by symbol
4. **`test_xgboost_fix.sh`** - Quick test script to verify XGBoost fixes

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Diagnose the Class Imbalance
```bash
python diagnose_class_imbalance.py
```
This will show you:
- How the win rate changes over time
- Which time periods have very few winning trades
- Performance by trading symbol

### Step 2: Rebuild Data (Clean Start)
```bash
python rebuild_data.py
```
This will:
- Check all prerequisites
- Backup existing data
- Reprocess everything with the fixed pipeline
- Validate the results

### Step 3: Run the Model
```bash
python src/models/xgboost_baseline.py
```

## Potential Solutions for Class Imbalance

Based on the diagnostics, you may need to:

1. **Use Stratified Temporal Splitting**: Instead of pure temporal splits, ensure each split has a minimum number of positive samples

2. **Adjust Time Periods**: If recent periods have very few wins, consider:
   - Using only data from periods with reasonable win rates
   - Adjusting split ratios (e.g., 70/15/15 instead of 60/20/20)

3. **Consider Different Evaluation Metrics**: With extreme imbalance, accuracy is misleading. Focus on:
   - Precision-Recall curves
   - F1 score
   - Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)

4. **Threshold Optimization**: Instead of using 0.5 as the decision threshold, optimize it based on business requirements

## Repository State

All fixes have been committed to the main branch:
- Fixed `phase1_data_preparation.py` to drop categorical columns
- Fixed `xgboost_baseline.py` to handle edge cases and JSON serialization
- Added diagnostic and rebuild scripts

The data preparation pipeline now:
- Properly drops categorical columns after one-hot encoding
- Excludes any remaining object columns from features
- Logs class distributions for all splits

## Important Notes

1. **IBKR Data Required**: Make sure you have all IBKR data downloaded before rebuilding
2. **Processing Time**: Rebuilding data takes several minutes due to feature engineering
3. **Validation Warnings**: Pay attention to class distribution warnings - they indicate potential issues

## Success Criteria

After rebuilding, you should see:
- No object/string columns in the feature list
- Reasonable positive sample ratios in all splits (ideally >5%)
- Model training without errors
- Meaningful evaluation metrics (not just 99.9% accuracy with 0 recall)
