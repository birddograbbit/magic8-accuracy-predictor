# Project Summary for Next Chat - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

## ⚠️ URGENT: Phase 1 Has Failed - Multiple Critical Issues

### Current Status (June 29, 2025)

**Phase 1 Results**: COMPLETE FAILURE
- **Test Accuracy**: 50.2% (random chance)
- **Model Behavior**: Predicts almost all trades as losses
- **Overfitting**: 70.9% train vs 50.2% test accuracy
- **Missing Data**: Only 1 of 4 expected strategies found

## 🔴 Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. Model Performance Catastrophe
- The model achieves 50% accuracy by predicting ALL samples as losses
- Out of 4,744 actual wins, it correctly identifies only 214 (4.5% recall)
- This is WORSE than the previous 49.34% from the last chat
- The v2 features made things worse, not better

### 2. Missing Strategy Data
**Expected**: 4 strategies (Butterfly, Iron Condor, Sonar, Vertical)
**Found**: Only Butterfly (97%) and Unknown (0.3%)

This means either:
- The data collection is incomplete
- Other strategies were never traded during this period
- There's a preprocessing error filtering them out

### 3. Technical Issues
- Severe overfitting despite regularization attempts
- Early stopping at iteration 6 (way too early)
- VIX data failed to load in analysis script
- Mixed data types warnings

## 📋 Diagnostic Tools Created

1. **check_strategies.py** - Investigates missing strategy types
2. **diagnose_phase1_model.py** - Comprehensive model failure analysis
3. **src/models/xgboost_improved.py** - Better model with fixes
4. **PHASE1_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md** - Complete issue documentation

## 🚀 Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Run Diagnostics (5 minutes)
```bash
python check_strategies.py        # Find out where strategies went
python diagnose_phase1_model.py   # Full model diagnostic
```

### Step 2: Try Improved Model (10 minutes)
```bash
python src/models/xgboost_improved.py
```

### Step 3: Investigate Data Source
If only Butterfly trades exist, we need to either:
- Find the missing strategy data
- Pivot to a Butterfly-only model
- Check if this is a data export issue

## 🔧 What the Improved Model Fixes

**Better Regularization**:
- max_depth: 6 → 3
- min_child_weight: 1 → 10
- reg_alpha: 0 → 1.0
- reg_lambda: 1 → 2.0

**Better Training**:
- early_stopping_rounds: 10 → 30
- eval_metric: accuracy → logloss
- Optimal threshold selection via F1

**Feature Cleaning**:
- Removes constant features
- Removes low-variance features
- Better preprocessing pipeline

## 📊 Expected Improvements

If the improved model works:
- F1 Score: 0.08 → 0.30+
- More balanced predictions
- Better minority class detection
- Actual learning instead of memorization

## ❓ Key Questions to Answer

1. **Where are the other 3 strategy types?**
   - Run `check_strategies.py` first
   
2. **Is the data complete?**
   - Check the original data source
   
3. **Should we proceed with Butterfly-only?**
   - Depends on findings from #1 and #2

## 🎯 Decision Tree

```
Run check_strategies.py
    ├── If other strategies found → Fix preprocessing
    ├── If only Butterfly exists → 
    │   ├── Check original data source
    │   └── Decide: Single-strategy or wait for data
    └── If naming issue → Map strategy names correctly
```

## 📝 Repository State

- **Status**: Phase 1 failed with 50% accuracy
- **Root Cause**: Model defaults to predicting all losses + missing strategies
- **Solutions**: Improved model ready + diagnostic tools
- **Blockers**: Missing 3 of 4 expected strategy types
- **Time to Fix**: ~30 minutes with provided tools

## Remember from Previous Analysis

The previous session identified that prof_reward/prof_risk weren't predictive, which is still true. But now we have a bigger problem: the model isn't learning anything at all, and we're missing most of the strategy data.
