# Magic8 Accuracy Predictor - Project Summary for Next Chat

## Project Overview
Building a machine learning system to predict win/loss outcomes for Magic8's 0DTE options trading system using XGBoost and historical market data.

**Repository**: https://github.com/birddograbbit/magic8-accuracy-predictor

## Key Issue Resolved
Previously, the model was using the wrong target variable (`trad_profited` with only 301 records). We fixed this to use the `prof_raw` column which represents the pure P/L at expiration without manual intervention, giving us 30,649 records with proper win/loss labels.

## Current Status (Phase 1 - Complete)

### Data Preparation ✅
- **Raw profit column identified**: `prof_raw` (Raw P/L at expiration)
- **Records with targets**: 30,649 out of 47,632 total
- **Overall win rate**: 33.38%
- **Features engineered**: 35 features including:
  - Temporal features (hour, minute, day of week, etc.)
  - Price features (close, SMA, momentum, RSI, etc.) 
  - VIX features (level, SMA, change, regime)
  - Strategy features (Butterfly, Iron Condor, Vertical)
  - Trade features (premium normalized, risk-reward ratio)

### Class Distribution
- **Train**: 28,579 samples (21.3% wins)
- **Validation**: 9,526 samples (53.3% wins)
- **Test**: 9,527 samples (49.8% wins)

Note: The lower win rate in training data suggests the trading strategy improved over time.

### IBKR Data ✅
All symbols downloaded with 5-minute bars:
- SPX, SPY, XSP, NDX, QQQ, RUT, AAPL, TSLA, VIX

## Next Steps for New Chat

### 1. Run XGBoost Model
```bash
python src/models/xgboost_baseline.py
```
Expected outcomes:
- Better performance metrics than the previous 99.9% accuracy / 0% recall
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance breakdown by strategy

### 2. Model Optimization
Based on initial results:
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Threshold optimization for better precision/recall balance
- Consider class weight adjustments for train set imbalance

### 3. Advanced Analysis
- Performance by time period (to understand strategy evolution)
- Feature engineering improvements
- Cross-validation with time series splits

### 4. Phase 2 Planning
If Phase 1 results are promising (>60% accuracy):
- Add cross-asset correlations
- Market microstructure features
- Options Greeks if available
- Consider ensemble methods or neural networks

## Key Files
- `src/phase1_data_preparation.py` - Fixed to use prof_raw
- `src/models/xgboost_baseline.py` - Ready to run
- `data/phase1_processed/` - Clean processed data
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Details of all fixes applied

## Important Context for Next Chat
1. We're using `prof_raw` (raw P/L at expiration) as the target, not managed P/L
2. The training set has lower win rate (21.3%) than val/test (~50%), suggesting temporal performance changes
3. All categorical columns are properly handled (dropped after one-hot encoding)
4. The model handles edge cases and JSON serialization properly

## Commands to Start Next Session
```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Check current status
python diagnose_features.py

# Run the model
python src/models/xgboost_baseline.py

# If needed, view results
cat models/phase1/results.json
```

## Success Metrics
- Target accuracy: >60% (significantly better than 33.38% baseline)
- Balanced precision/recall
- Consistent performance across strategies
- Meaningful feature importances

Ready to continue with model training and optimization in the next chat!
