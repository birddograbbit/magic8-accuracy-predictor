# Phase 1 MVP Summary - Magic8 Accuracy Predictor

## What We've Done

I've restructured the Magic8 accuracy predictor to focus on a practical Phase 1 MVP that uses only readily available data. This approach prioritizes getting a working system quickly (2 weeks) before adding complexity.

## Key Changes from Original Plan

### 1. Realistic Feature Set
**Before**: 100+ features requiring exotic data sources  
**Now**: ~60-70 features using only:
- Your existing trade data
- IBKR historical price data
- Calculated technical indicators

### 2. Available Data Sources Only
**Before**: VVIX, cross-asset correlations, microstructure data, historical options  
**Now**: 
- Price data from IBKR (SPX, SPY, VIX, etc.)
- Your normalized trade results
- Simple technical indicators

### 3. Simple Model First
**Before**: Complex Transformer ensemble  
**Now**: XGBoost baseline with proper evaluation

## Phase 1 Implementation (2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Data Pipeline
1. Download IBKR data for all symbols
2. Integrate with your trade data
3. Calculate basic features
4. Create train/test splits

### Week 2: Model & Evaluation
1. Train XGBoost baseline
2. Evaluate by strategy
3. Feature importance analysis
4. Document results

## New Files Created

### Core Implementation
- `src/phase1_data_preparation.py` - Simplified data pipeline
- `src/models/xgboost_baseline.py` - Baseline model with evaluation
- `download_phase1_data.sh` - Helper script for IBKR downloads
- `PHASE1_PLAN.md` - Detailed Phase 1 plan
- `configs/phase1_config.yaml` - Simple configuration

### Features in Phase 1

#### Temporal (9 features)
- Hour, minute, day of week
- Cyclical encoding (sin/cos)
- Market session indicators
- Minutes to close (0DTE decay)

#### Price-Based (5-6 per symbol, ~40 total)
- Current price
- 20-period SMA
- 5-period momentum
- 20-period volatility
- RSI (14-period)
- Price position in range

#### VIX (6 features)
- VIX level
- VIX SMA
- VIX changes
- Volatility regime (4 levels)

#### Trade-Specific (8-10 features)
- Strategy encoding (3 strategies)
- Premium normalized
- Risk-reward ratio
- Trade probability

## How to Use Phase 1

### 1. Download IBKR Data
```bash
# Ensure IBKR TWS/Gateway is running
./download_phase1_data.sh
```

### 2. Process Data
```bash
python src/phase1_data_preparation.py
```

### 3. Train Model
```bash
python src/models/xgboost_baseline.py
```

## Expected Results

- **Accuracy**: > 60% (baseline is 50%)
- **Training Time**: < 5 minutes
- **Prediction Time**: < 1 second
- **Works for all 3 strategies**

## What's NOT in Phase 1

### Data We're Not Using
- Historical option chains
- Cross-asset correlations (bonds, currencies)
- Market microstructure (bid-ask spreads)
- Complex indicators requiring multiple data sources

### Models We're Not Building
- Transformers
- Deep learning
- Complex ensembles
- Real-time systems

## Phase 2 and Beyond

After Phase 1 works, we can selectively add:
1. Features that show high importance
2. Additional data sources if justified
3. More complex models if simple ones plateau
4. Production deployment

## Key Advantages

1. **Fast Implementation**: 2 weeks to working model
2. **Uses Available Data**: No hunting for data
3. **Measurable Progress**: Clear baseline to improve
4. **Low Risk**: Simple approach, proven methods
5. **Iterative**: Learn what works before complexity

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Must Achieve
- ✓ Working data pipeline
- ✓ Trained model with > 60% accuracy
- ✓ Feature importance rankings
- ✓ Performance by strategy
- ✓ Clear next steps

### Nice to Have
- Performance by market regime
- Temporal performance analysis
- Error analysis by feature

## Technical Decisions

1. **XGBoost**: Fast, interpretable, works well with tabular data
2. **5-minute bars**: Good balance of data volume and signal
3. **Temporal splits**: Realistic evaluation for time series
4. **Class weighting**: Handle imbalanced win/loss data

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Download IBKR data and run pipeline
2. **This Week**: Get baseline results
3. **Next Week**: Iterate on features
4. **Future**: Plan Phase 2 based on learnings

This Phase 1 approach gives you a working system in 2 weeks with clear paths for improvement.
