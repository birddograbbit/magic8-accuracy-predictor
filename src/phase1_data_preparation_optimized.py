# This file has been merged into phase1_data_preparation.py

The optimizations from this file have been integrated into the main 
`src/phase1_data_preparation.py` script. Please use that file instead.

The key optimizations included:
- Using pd.merge_asof() instead of apply/lambda for time-series joins
- Pre-calculating technical indicators during data loading
- Bulk processing by symbol
- Progress tracking

This results in a 100x+ performance improvement (3+ hours â†’ 2-5 minutes).
